# [cli-v0.1.0](https://github.com/robgonnella/releasaurus/releases/tag/cli-v0.1.0) - 2025-08-23

### ‚ùå Breaking Changes

[**breaking**]: Refactors changelog to return output struct [_(cf932cf7)_](https://github.com/robgonnella/releasaurus/commit/cf932cf74eb63557924cc8d4f7e807a1d2ff52cf)
> Instead of separate traits, this approach is more streamlined by
returning an output struct that includes current_version, next_version,
and is_breaking as fields.
> Removes CurrentVersion and NextVersion traits and
modifies Generator and Writer traits to instead return an Output struct
which includes current_version, next_version, and is_breaking as fields

[**breaking**]: Improves monorepo setup [_(a9e4a00c)_](https://github.com/robgonnella/releasaurus/commit/a9e4a00c8f5dd52e74e78240aa7dc538834a8027)
> Uses an iterator setup on Config allowing users to simply loop the
config into SinglePackageConfigs. This is more intuitive than generating
each SinglePackageConfig by index directly.
> Toml config property changed from packages to package
as it's more idiomatic. In toml it's common to represent a list item as
the singular form encased in double brackets i.e. `[[package]]`

[**breaking**]: Removes support for bitbucket [_(c4352932)_](https://github.com/robgonnella/releasaurus/commit/c43529320250da2e2a08152965818a581d4726d2)
> Removes support for bitbucket remote. We will decide
later if we want to include support for this forge
